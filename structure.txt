HOW THE APP SHOULD WORK

1. User types hours / minutes / seconds
  1.1. User should be able to type any combination of these 
  (i.g. 1 hour 5 seconds / 3 minutes 10 seconds)
  1.2. User should have the possibility of filling one of fields and timer should start
  anyway (i.g. 1 hour / 6 minutes / 23 seconds )

2. Timer starts based on the user's input 
  2.1 Timer is counting backwards to 0 
  2.2 If it is a number between 0 and 9 it should show 0 + that number
  (i.g 5 => 05)
